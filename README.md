# TechClub site

We use the web-framework [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) and  the front-end framework [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) to build our site [techclub.us](http://techclub.us).

# Help us

We need some help to improve our site:

* a singular interface;
* an English version (add I18n);
* text improvements;
* things you think that would be great.

## How?

If it is not a revolution, just fork and make a Pull Request.

Otherwise you can post in our [forum](forum.techclub.us), using the `META` category and we can talk about the patch.
